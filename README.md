# Ktor Fullstack Template
This is a Template for creating Full Stack Web Applications.

# Credits
This Template is basically this https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/jvm-js-fullstack edited to be a template :)

# How to use it
Create a Template with the button\
Edit the group in build.gradle.kts\
Edit the name of the project in the settings.gradle.kts (this will be the name of the js file so rename that too in the index.html)\
That's it I guess
